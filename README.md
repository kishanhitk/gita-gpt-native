## Installation

### Prerequisites:

- Bun (https://bun.sh)
- Expo CLI (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kishanhitk/gita-gpt-native.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Gita-GPT
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

4. Start the Expo development server:
    ```bash
    bun expo run:android
    ```
    You can't run the app with Expo Go, as it uses Google login and other features that are not supported in the Expo Go app. You can run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.


## Technologies Used

- Expo 50 
- React Native
- Expo Router v3
- Nativewind v4 (Since v4 is in alpha, sometimes it may not work as expected. But I had to use it because the v2 does not work with Expo Router v3. The code has a lot of messy workarounds to make it work.)
